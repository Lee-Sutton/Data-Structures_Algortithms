* Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorith
- Directed or Undirected graphs
- With weighted edges
- Want to find the shortest path between the start and destination
Step 1. Include s in a closed set and all immediate successors of s
 and place all their distances in the open setpoint
Step 2. Pick the open node of least cost

- If the node that is picked is the destination (d) we stop
- otherwise we compute all successors of n
- add the distance from s to n+n edge to k
- and if it improves on value in the open set, store it as a new value
- Guarentees a shortest path
